		<p>Cover the dough with cling film, a tea towel or the lid of your bowl (don't seal that completely), then place it at a warm spot, e.g. close to a radiator. You can also preheat your oven to 50°C, then turn it off and place the dough in there fill the sink with warm water and place the bowl in there. Let the dough prove for around 1 hour or until it has doubled in size.</p>

		<p>Cover with tomato sauce, add whatever toppings you like (sliced mushrooms, tomatoes, tuna, sausage - there are (almost) no limits; but keep in mind, the higher you pile on the toppings the higher the chances are that you will end up with soggy dough...).

		<p>Now you have to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1teUhznIYeU">decide on the shape of your pasta</a>. For pappardelle - wide pasta ribbons - make sure the sheet of dough is dusted with flour on both sides, then fold it in half twice. This will make it easier to cut straight ribbons.</p>

	<div class="col-sm">

		<div class="number">10</div>
		<p>At this point you should have a large pot with boiling salted water ready to cook the pasta.</br>Cut ribbons of your desired width and gently separate the layers. Transfer the pasta into the boiling water and cook them until al dente - this will only take a few minutes, so make sure to check them regularly. Alternatively, you can store the pasta for later by letting it air-dry (make sure that individual pieces don't touch each other or they will stick).</p>
